# Creating a new React application

React applications should be built test-first, just like everything else. That means, according to YAGNI, we don't want anything in our applications that doesn't meet a needed specification, so we won't typically want to use `create-react-app` to avoid all of the extra stuff it includes.

## Pre-requisites

We need to have NPM, Jest, React, and Babel installed

### NPM

Make sure you have the latest NPM with

```
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Jest

Alternatives exist, but Jest is fine for now.

### Babel

We need Babel for a few things. It gets installed with Jest, so we really just need to add presets and plugins (a preset is a set of plugins). Each plugin enables a specific feature of the ECMAScript standards, or a preprocessor, such as JSX.

## Steps

1. Create and navigate to a new directory for the project.
2. `$ npm init` (the defaults are OK _except_ for the `test command` question: enter `jest`)
3. `$ npm install --save-dev jest`
4. `$ npm install --save react react-dom`
5. `$ npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react`
6. `$ npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-runtime`
7. `$ npm install --save @babel/runtime`
8. Enable the packages we've just installed by creating a new file `.babelrc` with the contents

```
{
    "presets": ["@babel/env", "@babel/react"],
    "plugins": ["@babel/transform-runtime"]
}
```

9. `$ npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom`
10. Add the test environment we just installed to the project by opening `package.json` and adding the following section at the bottom:

```json
{
    ...,
    "jest": {
        "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
    }
}
```

# Test Basics

Test-driven react development using Jest looks something like this:

```js
describe("Appointment", () => {
  it("renders the customer first name", () => {
    expect(document.body.textContent).toContain("Ashley");
  });
});
```

- The test files go in a directory which is separate from the `src` directory, since our tests should not have a one-to-one relationship with our application structure (as that would tightly-couple the two).
- The `describe()` function defines a _test suite_, and the first argument is the name of the **unit** you are testing.
- The `it()` function is the preferred test method; there are equivalents with different names, but `it` reads best.
  - The first argument to `it()` should be a string which is a present-tense phrase that describes the behavior we expect, as this reads very nicely in the Jest test results (assuming the name of the suit is the name of the unit, as in the above example).
- The `toContain()` function is an example of a _matcher_, and you can and should write your own matchers that are specific to your project.
